```
Create Spec: Create a very simple express.js server, which has only one endpoint, and get a text file containing "hello world". The "hello world" file is uploaded elsewhere so tha application doesn't need to worry about the file uploading. The app only cares about GET for that single file in S3. Try to minimize the use of middleware. Only use necessary security-related middlewares.
