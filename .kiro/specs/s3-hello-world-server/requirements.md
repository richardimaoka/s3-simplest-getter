# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a minimal Express.js server using TypeScript and ESM (ES Modules) that serves a single text file containing "hello world" from Amazon S3. The server will have only one GET endpoint and will use minimal middleware, focusing only on necessary security-related middleware. The application assumes the file is already uploaded to S3 and only handles retrieval.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a client, I want to make a GET request to retrieve a "hello world" text file, so that I can access the content stored in S3.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client makes a GET request to the designated endpoint THEN the system SHALL return the "hello world" text file content from S3
2. WHEN the S3 file is successfully retrieved THEN the system SHALL return HTTP status 200 with the file content
3. WHEN S3 is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return HTTP status 503 with an appropriate error message
4. WHEN the requested file doesn't exist in S3 THEN the system SHALL return HTTP status 404 with an appropriate error message
5. WHEN S3 authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return HTTP status 500 with a generic error message
6. WHEN any S3 error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the error details for debugging purposes
7. WHEN the response is sent THEN the system SHALL include appropriate content-type headers for text files

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the server to be configurable through environment variables, so that I can deploy it in different environments without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL read S3 configuration from environment variables
2. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL fail to start with a clear error message
3. WHEN the server port is specified via environment variable THEN the system SHALL use that port
4. WHEN no port is specified THEN the system SHALL default to port 3000
